Maven Through Terminal :- 
1.Install the Maven tar file after verifing the signatue
2.After installing the Maven, check its version from terminal by using the below command
                           
                                   mvn -version

To generate project we use this Command :- 

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=helloworld -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maven Lifecycle Phases :- ( 8 phases )
 
1.Validate:-check if the project is correct,having all the neccessary information 
             
                                  ( mvn validate )

2.Compile :- Compile the source code of the project 

( mvn compile )

3.test :- test the Compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework . these tests shouldnot require the code be packed or deployed

( mvn test )

4.Package:-take the compiled code and package it in its distribute formate,such as a JAR

( mvn package )

5.Integration test :- Process and deploy the package into an environment where integration tests can be run 

( mvn integration test )

6.Verify :- run any check to verify the package is valid and meets quility criteria 

( mvn verify )

7.Install :- install the package into the local repository for use as a dependence in other projects locally 

( mvn install )

8.Deploy :- done in an integration or release environment , copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with others developers and projects

( mvn deploy ) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Local repository -- .m2 folder 
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache maven has an advantage i.e., when we run any of the life cycle phases which will also include previous lifecycle phases as well 
ex:- If we run ( mvn package ) ( which is 4th phase ) , which will also run previous Phases as well ( Validite , Compile , test )
