*Web server --- JBOSS Wildfly
*What is JBOSS ?
   
    JBOSS is a powerful open source Java application sever developed by Red Hat 

*From wildfly.org , we can download it from this
  
   *Current version is 35.0.0.Final
   *Click on "ZIP"
   *It have 2 portnumber in wildfly 
        1.admin :- 9990
        2.Application/Artifacts :- 8080
Admin <URL : 9990 >
*For Application access <URL :8080 >/application_name>
*Next after downloded completed after extract the file of wildfly
*The folder structure of the wildfly
    1.domin
    2.modules
    3.welcome content
    4.docx
    5.bin
    6.appclient
*To Strat the wildfly go to the name folder of wildfly the "bin" folder
           File Name :- Standlone ( windows Bathch file )
*How to shutdown the wildfly ?
    Click on ( x )
*How to Create Management user ?
    < Home folder of wildfly > ---> bin 
    Filename :- add-user ( windows batch file )
*When we run , It asks which user do you want to add
   
    a) Management user ( Admin ) ( mgmt-user.properties )
    b) Application user ( Application-users.properties )
 a) a , Click on Enter
* And now it will ask user name & again click enter it will ask password & Enter It will ask re-type the password
* How to access the wildfly
   
    Admin/Management Console : < URL : 9990 >
    username & Password
*one of the folder in "Standalone" where we have the "configuration", and deployment and "logs"

===================================================================================================================
Configuration :- Where we will be having configurations , Applications , userspecifics 
    Eg :- mgmt-users.properties & mgmt-groups.properties

Logs :- Standalone ---> Log ---> Logs of the wildfly 

Deployments :- 
*A Deployment represents anything that can be deployed ( eg :- An Application such as EJB - JAR , WAR , EAR , any kind of standard archive such as RAR or JBOSS-specific deployment ) into a server
*you can use drag and drop to add new content or replace existing deployments . simply drag one or several files onto the deploment column . IF there's already a deployment with the same name the deployment will replaced , otherwise the deployment will be added . The deployment added by drag and drop will be enabled by default 
*left side -----> Upload deployment 
                  Un managed deployment 
                  Create Empty deployment
====================================================================================================================

How to deploy the artifact ?
 
    1. Copying the warfile and pasting it deployment folder of wildfly ( Home of wildfly --> Standalone --> Deployments )
    2.CP < artifacts source path > < destination of deployments of wildfly > 
    3.JBOSS wildfly GUI --> upload Artifact
===================================================================================================================== 

To Shutdown we use JBOSS-cli ( windows batch file ) ( enter connect next enter and next text shutdown press enetr ) then it will shutdown 
*Change port number

      Standalone --> Configuration --> standalone.xml --> standlonefull.xml 
*we have to change the two .xml files then only it will change the portnumbers

Configuration:-

Things to keep in mind before changing configurational changes :-

1.Where to change
2.Backup
3.How to change
4.Try ( or ) experiment in local environment
5.Documentation
======================================================================================================================

Snapshot / Backup :-
 *server.xml_history ( this will have the snapshot )
For wildfly - configuration --> Home folder of wildfly --> standalone --> configuration --> standalone.xml_history

File name : Standlone.v1 different status of the artifacts deployed in wildfly . In wildfly deployed artifacts can have various status states including 

Key Deployment Status in WildFly:
Deployed:
The application is successfully deployed and running on the WildFly server.
 
Undeployed:
The application has been removed from the server and is not currently running. 
Deployment process encountered an error and the application is not running.
 
Starting:
The application is currently being initialized and is not yet fully available.
 
Stopping:
The application is in the process of being gracefully shut down.
 
Suspended:
The application is temporarily paused and not actively processing requests.
 
Redeploying:
An existing deployed application is being updated with new code and re-deployed.
 
How to Check Deployment Status:
WildFly Management Console: Access the WildFly management console through a web interface to view the deployment status of all applications.
Command Line: Use the WildFly CLI to query the status of individual deployments. 

=====================================================================================================================

In JBoss WildFly, a "domain controller" acts as the central management point for a group of servers within a domain, overseeing configuration changes and ensuring consistency across all servers, while a "host controller" is responsible for managing the individual application server instances running on a specific host machine, communicating with the domain controller to apply configuration updates and start/stop server processes on that host. 

Key points about domain and host controllers:

Domain controller:

1.Stores the overall domain configuration in a "domain.xml" file.
2.Manages the entire domain, including server groups, deployments, and configuration settings.
3.Can be a dedicated server or configured on one of the host controllers.

Host controller:
1.Manages the application servers running on a specific host.
2.Reads its configuration from a "host.xml" file which defines details specific to that host.
3.Communicates with the domain controller to apply changes to its local server instances.
