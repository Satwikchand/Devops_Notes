"VCS" :- Version Control System 
"SCM":- Source code management 
"LVCS" :- Local version control system
"CVCS" :- centralised version control system
"DVCS" :- Distributed version control system 

1.Why need version control ?
A.*For collaboration *for storing version *figuring out what happen *backup

2.Issues without version control ?
A.*Once saved all changes made in the files as permanent and cannot be reverted back. 
  *No record of what was done by whom.
  *Down time that can occur because of faulty update could cost millions in loses.

3.What is version control ?
A. Version control is a system that documents changes made to a file or set of files. It allows multiple users to 
manage multiple versions of the same unit of information.it is snapshot of your project over time.

4.Version control types ?
A. "LVC" :-*The practice of having the version database in the local computer.
         *Local database keeps a record of the changes made to the files in version database
  Issues :-Multiple people working on same project.
  Solution :-Centralised version control

  "CVC" :-*Local version control issues are resolved by centralized version control.
          *In CVC a central repository is maintained where all the version files are kept.
          *Now users can checkout and check-in files from their different computers at any time. 
 Issues :- Incase central server failure while system goes down.
 Solution :-Distributed version control.

"DVC" :-* Version database is stored at every users local system at the end of the remote server.
        * Users manipulate the local files and then upload the changes to the remote server.
        * If any sever die, a client server can be used to restore.

                                   "Introduction to git"

What is git ?
Git is a open source distributed version control system. Which records changes made to the file laying emphasis
on speed, data integrity and distributed, non-linear workshop.

git --help :-It shows all the commands
git --version :-It shows the version
  
The git file workflow :- *The remote repository is a server where all the collaborators upload changes made to the file
                         *Local repository is users copy of the version database.
                         *The users access all the files through local repository and then push the changes made to the 
                          remote repository.
                         *Workspace is users active directory.
                         *The users modifying existing files and create new files in this space. git tracks these changes
                          compared to the local repository.
                         *Stage is a place where all the modified files marked to be committed are placed.
                         *Clone command creates copy of an existing remote repository inside the local repository.
                         *Push command pushes all the changes made in the local repository to the remote repository.
                         *Pull like fetch, gets all the changes from the remote repository and copies them to
                          the local repository.
                         *Pull merges those changes to the current working directory.

           .git :-When we clone the very first time empty repository having the two objects one is ".git" and another one is README.MD
