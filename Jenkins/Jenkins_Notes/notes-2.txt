How to change the default port no. of Jenkins
--------------------------------------------
 
 
  got to the path c:\programFiles\Jenkins  folder in the that folder find the Jenkins.xml file
 
search for ""--httpport=8080" in Jenkins .xml file
 
   (where 8080 is the default port no )
 
 
in order to change this default port no we should replace 8080 by our own port no. than save it once modified Jenkins.xml file restart the Jenkins server
 
 
[Note: Before doing any changes of Jenkins configuration or port no. its better to take backup of file for safer side .]
 
 
what if Jenkins Administrator forgot the password 
--------------------------------------------------
 
go to the Jenkins home directory
 
  c:\programFiles\Jenkins\.jenkins
 
  in that path open config.xml
 
  search for <useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
  replace true with false
 
   [like: <useSecurity>false</useSecurity>]
 
than Save it.
 
 
  than Access browser URL.
 
where you will not see user details or login details in Jenkin GUI and go for manger Jenkins-->security-->security realm
 
(when we change .xml file for true to false it will be none )
 
 
first here we need to change from none to Jenkins own user data base  this is about Authentication
 
Authorization (can we change the config.xml file to false Authorization will change to any one can do any thing )
 
 
here we need change from any one can do to either matrix based or project based strategy
 
under that  once changed the strategy under that uncheck the Anynomous and click on add user button, add the admin user and give the rule as Administrator.
than save it than we need to go for manager jenkins-->users-->go for manger Jenkins -->users -->go for admin user-->change the password  than save it.
 
now we need to restart the Jenkins
 
Note:
----
 
better take backup of confi.xml
for safer side
 
 
once restarting the Jenkins server check with admin user weather admin user as all the privileges or not .
 
than go back to config.xml file and modify use security tag. from false to true than restart the Jenkins server
 
 
using Jenkins environment variables 
------------------------------------:
 
Jenkins pipeline exposes environment variables via the global env, which is available from anywhere within  Jenkins file
 
URL : www.Jenkins.io/doc/book/pipiline/jenkinsfile/#using-environment-variables.(where we can find Jenkins variables)  
 
below are the some environment variables
 
1.BUILD_ID
 
     the current build id, identical to BUILDZ_NUMBER for builds created
 
like wise we have
 
BUILD_NUMBER, BUILD_TAG, BUILD_URL
 
JENKINS_URL, JOB_NAME
NODE_NAME, WORKSPACE
 
 
For example user Jenkins file(declarative pipeline)
pipeline-path URL (www.Jenkins.io/doc/book/pipiline/jenkinsfile/#using-environment-variables)
 
in that URL you will see code ,copy that create new item in Jenkins for pipeline job. replace script with copied code and save it and build it 
expected output  should be (running on http:localhost:8080)
 
 
how to parameterize the Jenkins job
-----------------------------------
 
parameter : parameter allows you to prompt for one or more inputs that will be passed into a build.
 
create a new job in general configuration of job , you can see the option tis project is parameterize need to check box that and where you will see 
option add parameter dropdown-->click on that-->you will see various parameters those are 
Boolean parameters 
choice parameter 
credential parameter
file parameter
multi-line string parameter 
Run parameter
String Parameter
 
for example : click on choice parameter 
            defines a simple parameter ,which can be selected from a list , you can use it during a build.
 
 
give the name as ENV and under choice u can give more than one environment and under description that will be to the user and click on save .
 
when you check the job to be trigger you will see build with parameter option click on that select the choices which we config , and go for build button .
 
 
another way create Jenkins user 
-------------------------------
 
manager Jenkins -->security-->allow user to sign up
