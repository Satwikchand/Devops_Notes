CI&CD --> Continuous Deployment & also Delivery Continous Integration 
Ways to trigger Jenkins Jobs :
 There are 5 types of ways :-  
❖  Setup automated actions that start your build based on 
specific events like code changes ( or ) Scheduled time  
Type – 1 : Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts) 
• In Order to use this trigger first we need to generate 
the authentication token of the Job  
• Enable this option if you would like to trigger new 
builds by accessing a special predefined URL 
• You'll need to provide an authorization token in the 
form of a string so that only those who know it would 
be able to remotely trigger this project's builds. 
• This is most useful when your Jenkins instance grants 
read access to this job to anonymous users. 
• When that's not the case, Jenkins will reject requests 
sent to the trigger URL even when the correct token 
is specified. 
• Use the following URL to Trigger build remotely : 
JENKINS
URL/job/ajafreestyle/build:token=TOKEN_NAME 
/build with Parameters ? token = TOKEN_NAME 
(or) 
Type – 2 : Build after other projects are built ( upstream &    
downstream) 
• Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish 
building, a new build is scheduled for this project. This is 
convenient for running an extensive test after a build is 
complete 
• We need to pass the Job name ( which are configured 
already ) under , Projects to watch  
• Trigger only if build is stable 
• Trigger even if the build is unstable 
• Trigger even if the build fails 
• Always trigger, even if the build is aborted 
Type – 3 : Build periodically ( Schedule ) 
• This field follows the syntax of cron ( with minor 
difference ) specifically each line consists of 5 fields 
separated by TAB (or) whitespace  
MINUTE     HOUR     DOM     MONTH    DOW 
❖ MINUTE : Minutes within the hour ( 0-59 ) 
❖ HOUR     : The hour of the day ( 0-23 ) 
❖ DOM       : The day of the month ( 1-31 ) 
❖ MONTH  : The month ( 1-12 ) 
❖ DOW       : The day of the week ( 0-7 ) , where 0 and 7 are   
Sunday 
• To specify multiple values for one field , the following operators 
are available in the order of precedence

Type – 4: GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling 
• When Jenkins receives a GitHub push hook, GitHub 
Plugin checks to see whether the hook came from a 
GitHub repository which matches the Git repository 
defined in SCM/Git section of this job.  
Type – 5: 
• Configure Jenkins to poll changes in SCM. 
• Note that this is going to be an expensive operation for 
CVS, as every polling requires Jenkins to scan the entire 
workspace and verify it with the server.
